# Orchid Initiative
Welcome to our idea warehouse! This is a collection of repositories for existing and potential projects where we collect and organize information as it is developed and discussed.  


### About Us

The Orchid Initiative is a non-profit organization dedicated to solving problems that often slip through the cracks in the current philanthropic environment.  We leverage the expertise of a large network of volunteers, composed of experienced professionals in many different fields, to create innovative solutions to problems faced by people who do not have the resources or expertise necessary to solve them themselves.  We believe that there are a large number of intelligent, creative, and hardworking people who would like to give back to the world but are unsure how to do so and do not have the time required to figure it out on their own.  The Orchid Initiative solves this disconnect with a three-step process.  First, we use our connections in the community to create a large pool of projects to help those in need.  Then we allow our network of volunteers to pick which projects they wish to help with and how much time they will be able to give.  Finally, we manage the project so that it is as simple as possible for our volunteers while interfacing with the community to ensure that it will have the desired benefit. The Orchid initiative tries to make it as easy and hassle-free as we can for both those in the community who identify problems and those in our volunteer network who help solve them.  We want to remove the barriers that stand between these two groups because we believe that good people working together can change the world.  And nothing should stand in their way.

### What is our goal?
Our goal is to establish a pipeline of passion projects that empower people to contribute concrete output with true impact.  We do this from three angles.

From one side, we look for good ideas that are under-resourced and connect them with an unconventional workforce. We are happy to put in the time to TRY to get traction for the project, even if it might not result in profit or success.

From another side, we look for people who want to develop or demonstrate skills and connect them with tasks and mentors.  The mentors we want to emulate can introduce a mentee to a big problem and distill it into achievable tasks. Our mentors lend their credibility and empower the mentee see themselves as capable of more.

From the third side, we look for teams of people that would like to put their expertise to good use and connect them with challenging, impactful projects and an engaging community of colleagues.
