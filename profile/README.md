Welcome to our idea warehouse! This is a collection of repositories for existing and potential future projects where we can collect and organize information as it is developed and discussed.  


### Who are we?
A rotating group of students and professionals who are motivated to work on interesting and challenging projects without recompense.


### What is our goal?
Our goal is to establish a pipeline of passion projects that empower people to contribute concrete output with true impact.

I want to help disadvantaged teenagers get mentors like I had - someone invested in their growth that can distill a problem down to something at their level. Lend their credibility and empower the mentee to do big things, and thus see themselves as capable of more.

Bust cynicism: we bring relentless optimism to obstacles that seem insurmountable.  We find the hands and brains to get the impossible done, one step at a time.


### What skills do we need?
- **Learners** - our hands.  Share your time and effort.  What skills are you motivated to practice/develop/apply?
- **Advocates** - our hearts.  Share your sense of purpose.  What problem do you want to solve?
- **Experts** - our brains.  Share your experience and influence.  What do you know how to accomplish?


### What kinds of projects do we work on?
We're still figuring that out.
