Welcome to our idea warehouse! This is a collection of repositories for existing and potential future projects where we can collect and organize information as it is developed and discussed.  


### Who are we?
A rotating group of students and professionals who are motivated to work on interesting and challenging projects that aim to make a social impact.


### What is our goal?
Our goal is to establish a pipeline of passion projects that empower people to contribute concrete output with true impact.  We do this from three angles.

From one side, we look for good ideas that are under-resourced and connect them with an unconventional workforce. We are happy to put in the time to TRY to get traction for the project, even if it might not result in profit or success.

From another side, we look for people who want to develop or demonstrate skills and connect them with tasks and mentors.  "I want to help disadvantaged teenagers get mentors like I had - someone invested in their growth that can introduce a learner to big problems and distill them into achievable tasks at their level. Lend their credibility and empower the mentee to do big things and to see themselves as capable of more."

From the third side, we look for teams of people that would like to put their expertise to good use and connect them with challenging, impactful projects and an engaging community of colleagues.

### What skills do we need?
- **Learners** - Share your time and effort.  What skills are you motivated to practice / develop / apply?
- **Advocates** - Share your sense of purpose.  What problem do you want to solve?  If you are willing to share your passion and ideas, we'll help supply the labor and build momentum.
- **Experts** - Share your experience and influence.  What do you know how to accomplish?


### What kinds of projects do we work on?
Right now, we are doing projects focused on hospital discharge data, healthcare for people experiencing homelessness, support for publication of medical research on rural health, and internships in biotechnology and gene therapy.
