# Welcome to the Orchid Initiative: Fostering Growth Together

At the Orchid Initiative, we draw inspiration from the intricate world of orchids, where each delicate bloom represents the power of symbiosis, resilience, and flourishing against all odds. Just like these remarkable flowers, our mission is to cultivate under-resourced projects and ideas, transforming them into vibrant, impactful endeavors that thrive in our unique ecosystem of support.


### About Us

Welcome to the Orchid Initiative, a non-profit organization dedicated to tackling overlooked challenges through innovative solutions. We believe in the untapped potential of individuals who want to give back but may feel uncertain about how to do so. Our mission is to bridge this gap with a straightforward approach.


### Our Approach

At Orchid, we cultivate a rich pool of community projects, leveraging our extensive connections. We empower our diverse network of skilled volunteers to choose projects aligned with their interests and the time they can dedicate. Simultaneously, we manage projects to make the experience as seamless as possible for our volunteers while ensuring the intended benefits are realized in the community.

### Our Goal

Our overarching goal is to establish a dynamic pipeline of passion projects that empower people to contribute tangible outcomes with real impact. We approach this goal from three angles:

- **Empowering Under-Resourced Ideas**
  
   We actively seek out promising ideas that lack resources and connect them with an unconventional workforce. We invest time and effort to promote these projects, even if financial success is uncertain.

- **Developing Skills Through Mentorship**

   We identify individuals eager to develop or showcase their skills and pair them with tasks and mentors. Our mentors guide mentees through significant challenges, distilling them into achievable tasks and empowering them to see their capabilities.

- **Engaging Expert Teams**

   We assemble teams of skilled individuals eager to apply their expertise to meaningful projects. By connecting them with impactful tasks and a vibrant community of colleagues, we create an environment where expertise meets purpose.


### What skills do we need?
- **Learners** - Share your time and effort.  What skills are you motivated to practice / develop / apply?
- **Advocates** - Share your sense of purpose.  What problem do you want to solve?  If you are willing to share your passion and ideas, we'll help supply the labor and build momentum.
- **Experts** - Share your experience and influence.  What do you know how to accomplish?


### What kinds of projects do we work on?
Right now, we are doing projects focused on hospital discharge data, healthcare for people experiencing homelessness, support for publication of medical research on rural health, and internships in biotechnology and gene therapy.

At the Orchid Initiative, we believe in making social impact accessible, removing barriers for both community members identifying problems and volunteers working to solve them. Together, we're changing the world, one impactful project at a time.
